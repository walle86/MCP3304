  Examples Sketch for MCP3304.h
  
  This example reads the voltage on CH0 and CH1 of an MCP3304 13bit ADC
  
  The circuit:
  * CH0 and CH1 to a potentiometer
  * DGND and AGND to Ground
  * VREF and VDD to +5V
  * CS/SHDN - to digital pin 10  (SS pin)
  * DIN - to digital pin 11 (MOSI pin)
  * DOUT - to digital pin 12 (MISO pin)
  * CLK - to digital pin 13 (SCK pin)
